Ansible configuration file

1. Default location: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
2. We can have conf file in  current directory
3. We can put conf file on home directory of a user as hidden file ~/.ansible.cfg
4. When conf. file is defined by env variable. 



Precedence order:

1. env variable has highest precedance:  $ export  ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/root/ansible.cfg
2. config. file in present working directory i.e ansible.cfg
3. config. file in home directory of a user as hidden file i.e ~/.ansible.cfg
4. config. file with default location i.e. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


Host file:
1. We can name it whatever we want and place that name in ansible conf file with path.
2. Either we can do entry in ungrouped format or in grouped format.
3. Host entry can be made in nested group also.


Adhoc commands:

Format: ansible        hosts                -m module_name    -a "arguments"
    
        Command    host_group_name
                   localhost/all/group_name

NOTE:
ansible --version
ansible all  --list-hosts
