Ansible configuration file
1. Default location: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
2. We can have conf file in  current directory
3. We can put conf file on home directory of a user as hidden file ~/.ansible.cfg
4. When conf. file is defined by env variable. 



Precedence order:

1. env variable has highest precedance:  $ export  ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/root/ansible.cfg
2. config. file in present working directory i.e ansible.cfg
3. config. file in home directory of a user as hidden file i.e ~/.ansible.cfg
4. config. file with default location i.e. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
